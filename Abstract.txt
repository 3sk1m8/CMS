ABSTRACT 

This project aims to develop a comprehensive Clinic Management System (CMS) tailored specifically for Carlex Clinic to enhance and streamline their operational processes. The proposed system will be a web-based application that integrates various functionalities essential for efficient clinic management. 

Carlex Clinic is located in the heart of Nairobi, Kenya, that emerged onto the healthcare landscape in the latter part of 2020. It is dedicated to providing quality medical care to the local community and beyond. As the clinic's reputation and patient base continue to grow, it has become increasingly apparent that an efficient and integrated system for managing various aspects of the clinic is necessary for continued success and improved service delivery. The current operations at Carlex Clinic rely on traditional manual methods and disparate systems for managing patient appointments, medical records and staff. The need for a CMS has become apparent to address several key challenges: ​

1. Operational Inefficiencies: Manual processes for appointment scheduling and patient records lead to inefficiencies, longer waiting times, and increased chances of errors. ​

2. Limited Accessibility and Data Integration: Lack of an integrated system hampers efficient access to patient records, treatment history, and real-time data, affecting decision-making and patient care. ​

3. Administrative Challenges: The current manual system requires significant administrative efforts and is prone to errors, impacting the clinic's overall management. 



In this project, we use PHP and MySQL database.​​ The entire project mainly consists of 3 modules, which are​​

* Admin module​ - view patients, doctors, appointments and new queries. Add doctors’, their specializations and manage them. View reports of patients for a defined period of time. Search patient. Update profile.​

* User module (patient)​ - Book appointment, View appointment history, view medical history. Update profile.​

​* Doctor module – View online appointments, manage patients (add/update), Search patient using name, update profile.



OBJECTIVES

1. Develop a user module for patient registration, appointment scheduling, and electronic health records (EHR) management. ​

2. Create a doctor module to optimize scheduling and update patients EHR. ​

3. Develop a reporting system to generate comprehensive reports on patient flow and resource utilization. ​

4. Design an admin module for the management of administrative tasks.
